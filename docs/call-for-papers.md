# Call for Papers

## Scope

Interactive visual workflows bring together computation, experimentation, artificial intelligence (AI), data, and rich visual interfaces into end-to-end pipelines that people can inspect, guide, and trust. Visualization is the central feature that ties together many steps, from visually defining and configuring simulations or experiments, through training and deploying AI and surrogate models, and running simulations and experiments on high-performance computing (HPC) back-ends with in situ and streaming support for inspection, to post-processing analysis and comparison of results that guide follow-on simulations and experiments. Across all of these, the goal is to replace long, opaque, tool-fragmented cycles with workflows that enable scientists and engineers to interact with their data and models in a more immediate, intelligible, and collaborative way.

We are designing the workshop to move this emerging area of HPC- and AI-enabled science and engineering forward in a coordinated way. We are particularly interested in giving the community space to name and refine the core ideas of interactive visual workflows, from the shared vocabulary we use to describe them to the patterns and questions that recur across domains. At the same time, we intend IVW to be a friendly place for work that is still taking shape, where participants can bring new tools, early results, design sketches, novel and informative visuals, and lessons from practice and get constructive feedback. By gathering domain scientists, visualization and graphics researchers, data and AI specialists, research software engineers, and facility staff in the same room, we hope to spark collaborations that would not emerge within a single discipline. The format also offers early-career contributors a chance to practice concise technical writing, reviewing, presenting, and demonstrating tools and workflows. We emphasize shareable workflows, code, data, and frameworks so that the community leaves with tangible artifacts that remain useful long after the workshop ends.

To support those goals, the workshop will not follow the familiar "keynote–papers–panel" formula. Instead, it will open with a short framing session led by the organizers to set the context, solicit core research questions on interactive visual workflows, and walk participants through the day's structure. We organize the rest of the morning into three clearly defined streams of contributions. In the first stream, contributors present selected four-page papers as focused talks that delve into concrete use cases, methods, and technologies, giving attendees a chance to see mature ideas and results. Between the first and third talk blocks, contributors of tools, platforms, and applications take part in a concise lightning round, with thirty seconds and a single slide each to convey the essence of their demonstration and help attendees decide which ones to visit in the poster-like session. In the third stream, contributors present two-page lightning papers in short, tightly timed slots, providing a structured venue for early ideas, exploratory designs, and strong opinions that benefit from quick feedback. 

During the tool, platform, and application demonstration sessions, attendees move among demonstration stations, interact directly with developers and users, see workflows in action, and dig into implementation details that rarely fit into a talk slot. The afternoon mirrors the morning pattern, with additional focused talks from selected four-page papers and short slots for two-page lightning papers, providing space for both deeper technical content and early-stage work that benefits from fast feedback and cross-pollination.

We close the day with a facilitated group "talk show"–style discussion centered on the challenges and opportunities ahead: what is working, what is missing, and where the community wants to go next. This conversation draws explicitly on themes from the talks and demonstrations. It feeds directly into our post-workshop artifacts, including a concise "state of the field and call to action" document that captures shared priorities and concrete next steps. This sequence keeps the morning and afternoon paced and coherent rather than chaotic, while still exposing attendees to a diverse mix of work.

## Reproducibility Initiative

For the Interactive Visual Workflows workshop, we align with SC's [Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc26.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/) by treating artifact sharing and re-execution as core expectations. In addition to the paper, authors will provide a brief artifact description outlining key software, data, and workflow elements, with links to any available artifacts and enough information to support practical re-running or inspection of central results in the spirit of SC's AD/AE guidelines.
