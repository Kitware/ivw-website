# Call for Papers

## Scope

We invite short (4-page) papers that highlight achievements, challenges, and best practices in using interactive visual workflows to accelerate science and engineering at scale, including action-oriented proposals as well as position and experience reports. Areas of interest for IVW include, but are not limited to, the following.

### Platforms and Ecosystems for Interactive Workflows  
Frameworks and environments that support building, sharing, and running high-performance, AI-enabled visual workflows.

### Concepts, Methods, and Practices for Visual Workflows  
Emerging patterns and methods for designing and operating high-performance, AI-augmented visual workflows in science and engineering.

### Applied Case Studies: Simulation, Experimentation, and Observation  
Real-world uses of interactive visual workflows, HPC, and AI in simulations, experiments, and observational studies.

### Enabling Technologies: HPC, AI, Data, and Networks  
The compute, data, networking, and AI technologies that make scalable interactive visual workflows possible.

### Human Experience and Access: Usability, UX, and Inclusive Facilities  
Interfaces, practices, and programs that broaden who can effectively use HPC, AI, and advanced visualization.

## Reproducibility Initiative

For the Interactive Visual Workflows workshop, we align with SC's [Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc26.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/) by treating artifact sharing and re-execution as core expectations. In addition to the paper, authors will provide a brief artifact description outlining key software, data, and workflow elements, with links to any available artifacts and enough information to support practical re-running or inspection of central results in the spirit of SC's AD/AE guidelines.

## Important Dates
