## Abstract

Researchers, practitioners, and tool builders come together in this workshop to reshape how we perform science and engineering by using interactive visual workflows as core instruments of discovery. Interactive visual workflows tightly couple computation, experimentation, AI, data, and rich visual interfaces, with **visualization as the central feature at each step** to support visual steering and inspection, deeper analysis, and more transparent communication. They directly tackle a growing bottleneck for SC attendees: teams spend so much time designing simulation and experiment campaigns, then analyzing and visualizing results, that this work increasingly dominates the path from project start to discovery and can even outlast available compute time. IVW highlights concrete approaches that shorten this design and analysis loop, often to days or the runtime of the computation itself, and showcases workflows that make complex pipelines understandable and actionable through focused papers, lightning contributions, and hands-on demonstrations.

## Relevance and Impact

**What is the relevance?** For SC attendees, a central bottleneck is the growing gap between data generation and actionable insight, as the time and effort spent designing simulation and experiment campaigns and then analyzing and visualizing results increasingly dominates the path from project start to discovery and, in many projects, takes longer than the period when teams actually have compute time on the supercomputer. An interactive visual workflow tightly couples computation, experimentation, AI, data, and rich visual interfaces, with visualization serving as the connective tissue among HPC, AI, data, and usability at each step of increasingly complex pipelines to support visual steering and inspection, deeper analysis, and more transparent communication. By focusing on interactive, domain-aware visual workflows that integrate AI, simulation, and experimental data, this workshop targets that bottleneck head-on and explores how to compress lengthy design and analysis into days or even into the runtime of the computation itself so that insight keeps pace with computation and instrumentation.

**How will it impact attendees?** The impact of this focus extends beyond performance metrics to who can meaningfully participate in HPC- and AI-driven science and engineering. Interactive visual workflows democratize capabilities often confined to computational specialists, making complex pipelines understandable and actionable for domain scientists, early-career researchers, and decision makers, while improving expertise transfer and supporting multi-audience analysis across desktops, Jupyter environments, HPC systems, and the web. We intend the workshop’s mix of focused papers, lightning contributions, and hands-on demonstrations to give attendees concrete workflows, tools, and design patterns they can adapt in their own environments, as well as early-stage ideas and emerging practices that point toward where the field is heading. DOI-backed artifacts, papers, slides, workflow descriptions, software, and images, together with a community-edited “state of the field, opportunities, and challenges” report, will provide durable reference points and a shared, forward-looking view of priorities for methods, infrastructure, and workforce development that attendees can carry back to their home institutions and future SC events.

## Community Building, Inclusivity, and Goals

IVW deliberately weaves community building and inclusivity into its technical focus, rather than treating them as add-ons. We involve early career participants directly in the life of the workshop by inviting them onto an Early Career Program Committee and into the review process, giving them guided experience with peer review, program shaping, and session logistics alongside more senior members. The organizers and program committee span academia, industry, and government laboratories, and we will expand the committee with attention to diversity in institution type, geography, career stage, and background so that the workshop reflects the range of communities it aims to serve.

The short, rigorously reviewed paper formats, both four-page and two-page, lower barriers to entry and act as idea incubators, encouraging contributions from groups that may not yet have a full-length journal paper but have valuable tools, workflows, visuals, and emerging results to share. The call for participation explicitly welcomes domain scientists, visualization and graphics researchers, data and AI specialists, facility staff, and research software engineers, mirroring the interdisciplinary nature of interactive visual workflows. Demonstration sessions further strengthen this mix by creating informal spaces where developers and users can discuss real-world practices. Together, these choices support early socialization of work, build bridges between communities, offer a venue for HPC practitioners to discuss the state of the practice, and create concrete opportunities for professional growth in technical communication, leadership, and service.
