## Proceedings and Community Report

We will produce a high-quality proceedings volume of peer-reviewed contributions and make it openly available in a repository that assigns citable, persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs). In support of the Interactive Visual Workflows workshop Ideation goal, we will also create a community "state of the field and call to action" report that synthesizes participant input and discussion into a shared view of the emerging sub-field, its community and workforce needs, and the key research and practice priorities.

## Advertising and Engagement

We will promote IVW: Interactive Visual Workflows for Science and Engineering at Scale primarily through a workshop website that will present the call for participation, topics of interest, key dates, program committee and chairs, and, once available, a link to the published proceedings. Announcements will be distributed via email lists associated with relevant tools and technologies, domain communities in computer graphics, visualization, and computational science and engineering, and established HPC announcement channels. We will also advertise the call and final program through the organizers' institutional communication channels and through direct outreach to community members to encourage submissions and participation.
