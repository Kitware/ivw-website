## Artifacts: Proceedings and Community Report

Expected outcomes include individual technical contributions in the form of DOI-backed artifacts and a community-level synthesis that can inform future SC workshops, funding strategies, and coordination across institutions and disciplines. We plan to publish proceedings and treat artifacts as first-class outputs. Peer-reviewed contributions, including four-page and two-page papers, slide decks, application and workflow descriptions, and selected images, will be curated on the IVW website and archived in a dedicated Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) community, where each item will receive a persistent, citable DOI. This combination gives contributors a stable reference for their work while keeping the workshop website as the primary, human-friendly entry point.

In support of the workshop’s ideation goals, we will also develop a community-edited “state of the field, opportunities, and challenges” report, hosted and iterated through the IVW website and archived alongside the proceedings in Zenodo. This report will synthesize participant input and discussion into a shared view of the emerging sub-field, its community and workforce needs, and key research and practice priorities, serving both as a snapshot of the current landscape and a roadmap for future work.


## Advertising and Engagement

We will promote IVW: Interactive Visual Workflows for Science and Engineering at Scale primarily through a workshop website that will present the call for participation, topics of interest, key dates, program committee and chairs, and, once available, a link to the published proceedings. Announcements will be distributed via email lists associated with relevant tools and technologies, domain communities in computer graphics, visualization, and computational science and engineering, and established HPC announcement channels. We will also advertise the call and final program through the organizers' institutional communication channels and through direct outreach to community members to encourage submissions and participation.
