## Abstract

This workshop brings together researchers, practitioners, and tool builders who are rethinking how science and engineering are done by treating interactive visual workflows as core instruments of discovery. Visualization is central, serving as the connective tissue among HPC, AI, data, and usability to support the design and steering of simulations and experiments, the exploration of complex results, and clearer communication of insight. We welcome contributions on visual workflow components as well as enabling technologies and practices, including AI- and ML-driven analysis, data management and streaming, workflow orchestration on advanced systems, and human-centered design for accessible, scalable interfaces.

## Scope

We invite short (4-page) papers that highlight achievements, challenges, and best practices in using interactive visual workflows to accelerate science and engineering at scale, including action-oriented proposals as well as position and experience reports. Areas of interest for IVW include, but are not limited to, the following.

**Platforms and Ecosystems for Interactive Workflows**  
Frameworks and environments that support building, sharing, and running high-performance, AI-enabled visual workflows.

**Concepts, Methods, and Practices for Visual Workflows**  
Emerging patterns and methods for designing and operating high-performance, AI-augmented visual workflows in science and engineering.

**Applied Case Studies: Simulation, Experimentation, and Observation**  
Real-world uses of interactive visual workflows, HPC, and AI in simulations, experiments, and observational studies.

**Enabling Technologies: HPC, AI, Data, and Networks**  
The compute, data, networking, and AI technologies that make scalable interactive visual workflows possible.

**Human Experience and Access: Usability, UX, and Inclusive Facilities**  
Interfaces, practices, and programs that broaden who can effectively use HPC, AI, and advanced visualization.

## Relevance and Impact

Interactive visual workflows sit at the intersection of simulation, experimentation, AI, and modern HPC, directly addressing a key bottleneck: the growing gap between data generation and actionable insight, as the time and effort spent designing campaigns and then analyzing and visualizing results increasingly dominates the path from project start to discovery and can even outlast allocation cycles. By focusing on interactive, domain-aware visual workflows that integrate AI, simulation, and experimental data, this workshop targets that gap head-on, exploring how to compress lengthy pre- and post-processing into days or even into the runtime of the computation itself so that insight keeps pace with computation and instrumentation.

An interactive visual workflow tightly couples computation, data, AI methods, and rich visual interfaces, with visualization as the central feature that lets people steer simulations and experiments, inspect streaming results, and adjust hypotheses in real time rather than waiting for long, disconnected pre- and post-processing cycles. The impact of this focus extends beyond performance metrics to who can meaningfully participate in HPC- and AI-driven science. Interactive visual workflows democratize capabilities often confined to computational specialists, making complex pipelines understandable and actionable for domain scientists, early-career researchers, and decision makers, while improving expertise transfer, supporting multi-audience analysis, and operating across desktops, Jupyter, HPC, and the web to accelerate discovery, collaboration, and transparent, inclusive, reproducible use of advanced computing.

## Community Building, Inclusivity, and Goals

IVW will intentionally combine inclusivity and community-building with its core workshop goals. We will mentor early-career participants by involving them in the review process and an Early Career Program Committee, while assembling diverse committees and contributors from academia, industry, and government labs. A 4-page, rigorously reviewed paper format lowers barriers to entry and serves as an idea incubator, encouraging participation from a broad range of voices.

Together, these choices support our goals of socializing early work, building bridges between interdisciplinary communities, offering a forum for HPC practitioners to share state-of-the-practice challenges and innovations, and creating opportunities for professional development in technical communication, leadership, and service.

## Artifacts: Proceedings and Community Report

We will produce a high-quality proceedings volume of peer-reviewed contributions and make it openly available in a repository that assigns citable, persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs). In support of the Interactive Visual Workflows workshop Ideation goal, we will also create a community “state of the field and call to action” report that synthesizes participant input and discussion into a shared view of the emerging sub-field, its community and workforce needs, and the key research and practice priorities.

## Reproducibility Initiative

For the Interactive Visual Workflows workshop, we align with SC’s [Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc26.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/) by treating artifact sharing and re-execution as core expectations. In addition to the paper, authors will provide a brief artifact description outlining key software, data, and workflow elements, with links to any available artifacts and enough information to support practical re-running or inspection of central results in the spirit of SC’s AD/AE guidelines.

## Advertising and Engagement

We will promote IVW: Interactive Visual Workflows for Science and Engineering at Scale primarily through a workshop website (URL TBD, to be hosted on GitHub) that will present the call for participation, topics of interest, key dates, program committee and chairs, and, once available, a link to the published proceedings. Announcements will be distributed via email lists associated with relevant tools and technologies, domain communities in computer graphics, visualization, and computational science and engineering, and established HPC announcement channels. We will also advertise the call and final program through the organizers’ institutional communication channels (including Kitware Inc., NVIDIA, LBNL, ANL, and TACC) and through direct outreach to community members to encourage submissions and participation.
