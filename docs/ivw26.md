## Abstract

Researchers, practitioners, and tool builders come together in this workshop to reshape how we perform science and engineering by using interactive visual workflows as core instruments of discovery. Interactive visual workflows tightly couple computation, experimentation, AI, data, and rich visual interfaces, with **visualization as the central feature at each step** to support visual steering and inspection, deeper analysis, and more transparent communication. They directly tackle a growing bottleneck for SC attendees: teams spend so much time designing simulation and experiment campaigns, then analyzing and visualizing results, that this work increasingly dominates the path from project start to discovery and can even outlast available compute time. IVW highlights concrete approaches that shorten this design and analysis loop, often to days or the runtime of the computation itself, and showcases workflows that make complex pipelines understandable and actionable through focused papers, lightning contributions, and hands-on demonstrations.

## Scope

Interactive visual workflows bring together computation, experimentation, artificial intelligence (AI), data, and rich visual interfaces into end-to-end pipelines that people can inspect, guide, and trust. **Visualization is the central feature that ties together many steps**, from visually defining and configuring simulations or experiments, through training and deploying AI and surrogate models, and running simulations and experiments on high-performance computing (HPC) back-ends with in situ and streaming support for inspection, to post-processing analysis and comparison of results that guide follow-on simulations and experiments. Across all of these, the goal is to replace long, opaque, tool-fragmented cycles with workflows that enable scientists and engineers to interact with their data and models in a more immediate, intelligible, and collaborative way.

We are designing the workshop to move this emerging area of HPC- and AI-enabled science and engineering forward in a coordinated way. We are particularly interested in giving the community space to name and refine the core ideas of interactive visual workflows, from the shared vocabulary we use to describe them to the patterns and questions that recur across domains. At the same time, we intend IVW to be a friendly place for work that is still taking shape, where participants can bring new tools, early results, design sketches, novel and informative visuals, and lessons from practice and get constructive feedback. By gathering domain scientists, visualization and graphics researchers, data and AI specialists, research software engineers, and facility staff in the same room, we hope to spark collaborations that would not emerge within a single discipline. The format also offers early-career contributors a chance to practice concise technical writing, reviewing, presenting, and demonstrating tools and workflows. We emphasize shareable workflows, code, data, and frameworks so that the community leaves with tangible artifacts that remain useful long after the workshop ends.

To support those goals, the workshop will not follow the familiar "keynote–papers–panel" formula. Instead, it will open with a **short framing session** led by the organizers to set the context, solicit core research questions on interactive visual workflows, and walk participants through the day's structure. We organize the rest of the morning into three clearly defined streams of contributions. In the first stream, contributors present selected **four-page papers** as focused talks that delve into concrete use cases, methods, and technologies, giving attendees a chance to see mature ideas and results. Between the first and third talk blocks, contributors of **tools, platforms, and applications** take part in a concise lightning round, with thirty seconds and a single slide each to convey the essence of their **demonstration** and help attendees decide which ones to visit in the poster-like session. In the third stream, contributors present **two-page lightning papers** in short, tightly timed slots, providing a structured venue for early ideas, exploratory designs, and strong opinions that benefit from quick feedback. 

During the **tool, platform, and application demonstration sessions**, attendees move among demonstration stations, interact directly with developers and users, see workflows in action, and dig into implementation details that rarely fit into a talk slot. The **afternoon mirrors the morning pattern**, with additional focused talks from selected four-page papers and short slots for two-page lightning papers, providing space for both deeper technical content and early-stage work that benefits from fast feedback and cross-pollination.

We close the day with a facilitated group **"talk show"–style discussion** centered on the challenges and opportunities ahead: what is working, what is missing, and where the community wants to go next. This conversation draws explicitly on themes from the talks and demonstrations. It feeds directly into our post-workshop artifacts, including a concise "state of the field and call to action" document that captures shared priorities and concrete next steps. This sequence keeps the morning and afternoon paced and coherent rather than chaotic, while still exposing attendees to a diverse mix of work.

## Relevance and Impact

**What is the relevance?** For SC attendees, a central bottleneck is the growing gap between data generation and actionable insight, as the time and effort spent designing simulation and experiment campaigns and then analyzing and visualizing results increasingly dominates the path from project start to discovery and, in many projects, takes longer than the period when teams actually have compute time on the supercomputer. An interactive visual workflow tightly couples computation, experimentation, AI, data, and rich visual interfaces, with visualization serving as the connective tissue among HPC, AI, data, and usability at each step of increasingly complex pipelines to support visual steering and inspection, deeper analysis, and more transparent communication. By focusing on interactive, domain-aware visual workflows that integrate AI, simulation, and experimental data, this workshop targets that bottleneck head-on and explores how to compress lengthy design and analysis into days or even into the runtime of the computation itself so that insight keeps pace with computation and instrumentation.

**How will it impact attendees?** The impact of this focus extends beyond performance metrics to who can meaningfully participate in HPC- and AI-driven science and engineering. Interactive visual workflows democratize capabilities often confined to computational specialists, making complex pipelines understandable and actionable for domain scientists, early-career researchers, and decision makers, while improving expertise transfer and supporting multi-audience analysis across desktops, Jupyter environments, HPC systems, and the web. We intend the workshop’s mix of focused papers, lightning contributions, and hands-on demonstrations to give attendees concrete workflows, tools, and design patterns they can adapt in their own environments, as well as early-stage ideas and emerging practices that point toward where the field is heading. DOI-backed artifacts, papers, slides, workflow descriptions, software, and images, together with a community-edited “state of the field, opportunities, and challenges” report, will provide durable reference points and a shared, forward-looking view of priorities for methods, infrastructure, and workforce development that attendees can carry back to their home institutions and future SC events.

## Community Building, Inclusivity, and Goals

IVW deliberately weaves community building and inclusivity into its technical focus, rather than treating them as add-ons. We involve early career participants directly in the life of the workshop by inviting them onto an **Early Career Program Committee** and into the review process, giving them guided experience with peer review, program shaping, and session logistics alongside more senior members. The organizers and program committee span academia, industry, and government laboratories, and we will expand the committee with attention to diversity in institution type, geography, career stage, and background so that the workshop reflects the range of communities it aims to serve.

The short, rigorously reviewed paper formats, both **four-page and two-page**, **lower barriers to entry and act as idea incubators**, **encouraging contributions** from groups that may not yet have a full-length journal paper but have valuable tools, workflows, visuals, and emerging results to share. The call for participation explicitly welcomes domain scientists, visualization and graphics researchers, data and AI specialists, facility staff, and research software engineers, mirroring the interdisciplinary nature of interactive visual workflows. **Demonstration sessions** further strengthen this mix by **creating informal spaces** where developers and users can discuss real-world practices. Together, these choices support early socialization of work, build bridges between communities, offer a venue for HPC practitioners to discuss the state of the practice, and create concrete opportunities for professional growth in technical communication, leadership, and service.

## Artifacts: Proceedings and Community Report

Expected outcomes include individual technical contributions in the form of DOI-backed artifacts and a community-level synthesis that can inform future SC workshops, funding strategies, and coordination across institutions and disciplines. We plan to publish proceedings and treat artifacts as first-class outputs. Peer-reviewed contributions, including four-page and two-page papers, slide decks, application and workflow descriptions, and selected images, will be curated on the IVW website and archived in a dedicated [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) community, where each item will receive a persistent, citable DOI. This combination gives contributors a stable reference for their work while keeping the workshop website as the primary, human-friendly entry point.

In support of the workshop’s ideation goals, we will also develop a community-edited “state of the field, opportunities, and challenges” report, hosted and iterated through the IVW website and archived alongside the proceedings in Zenodo. This report will synthesize participant input and discussion into a shared view of the emerging sub-field, its community and workforce needs, and key research and practice priorities, serving both as a snapshot of the current landscape and a roadmap for future work.

## Reproducibility Initiative

For the Interactive Visual Workflows workshop, we align with SC’s [Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc26.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/) by treating artifact sharing and re-execution as core expectations. In addition to the paper, authors will provide a brief artifact description outlining key software, data, and workflow elements, with links to any available artifacts and enough information to support practical re-running or inspection of central results in the spirit of SC’s AD/AE guidelines.

## Advertising and Engagement

We will promote IVW: Interactive Visual Workflows for Science and Engineering at Scale primarily through a workshop [website](https://kitware.github.io/ivw-website/) that will present the call for participation, topics of interest, key dates, program committee and chairs, and, once available, a link to the published proceedings. Announcements will be distributed via email lists associated with relevant tools and technologies, domain communities in computer graphics, visualization, and computational science and engineering, and established HPC announcement channels. We will also advertise the call and final program through the organizers’ institutional communication channels (including Kitware Inc., NVIDIA, LBNL, ANL, and TACC) and through direct outreach to community members to encourage submissions and participation.
