# High-Energy Physics Workflow with ACE3P

Simulation workflows often demand diverse computational resources. For instance, a high-energy physics workflow, leveraging SLAC's Advanced Computational Electromagnetics 3D Parallel (ACE3P) tools, is employed in the design of particle accelerators and related instrumentation. In this scenario, the user initiates the workflow on their local machine, while the intensive computations are executed on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources at NERSC. Users have the flexibility to perform remote post-processing on the HPC machine or conveniently transfer results for local processing, all within the same integrated tool.

**Frameworks used:** SMTK, CMB, ParaView, VTK
