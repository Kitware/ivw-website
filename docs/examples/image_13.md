# AI-Enhanced Simulation with Catalyst

![AI-Enhanced Simulation with Catalyst](/image_13.jpg)

In collaboration with NASA and the University of Colorado Boulder, Kitware is expanding the Catalyst in situ analysis platform to enable powerful AI models to access simulation data in memory at runtime for advanced model training and inference to improve upon existing simulation results. This approach empowers existing, validated simulation codes to leverage modern AI tools without complex and costly code integrations.

**Frameworks used:** Catalyst, ParaView
