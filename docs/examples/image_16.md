# DREAM3D-NX - Microstructural Data Visualization

![DREAM3D-NX - Microstructural Data Visualization](/image_16.jpg)

Displaying complex microstructural data is an integral part of many material science workflows and enables researchers to explore and understand the intricate geometries and properties of materials. This integration is crucial for analyzing simulated and experimental data, facilitating insights into material behavior, and accelerating the discovery of new materials with desired characteristics. The above image shows 3D precipitate morphology from a nickel based superalloy. Reconstruction was performed by DREAM3D-NX and subsequently visualized within DREAM3D-NX using VTK to provide advanced 3D rendering and visualization capabilities essential for material science research.

**Frameworks used:** DREAM3D-NX, VTK
