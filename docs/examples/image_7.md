# MultivariateView - Multimodal Volume Visualization

![MultivariateView - Multimodal Volume Visualization](/image_7.jpg)

Visualizing and exploring multivariate/multimodal volumes, common in material modeling and medical simulations, demands innovative techniques. These techniques are crucial for revealing significant trends and effectively communicating discoveries to both domain experts and general audiences. As an example, the accompanying figure presents an x-ray fluorescence tomography dataset of a mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC), analyzed using Kitware's MultivariateView tool.
