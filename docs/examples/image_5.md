# Whole-Body Circulatory System Simulation

![Whole-Body Circulatory System Simulation](/image_5.jpg)

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is integral to whole-body circulatory system workflows, supporting the development of new surgical procedures and patient health monitoring. These workflows often run continuously, necessitating in situ visualization for real-time observation by physicians and researchers.

The accompanying images illustrate work from the Randles Lab at Duke University, where methods for whole-body circulatory system simulation are being developed, modeling down to individual blood cells using the HARVEY fluid dynamics solver. The video showcases blood flow within a representative human aorta, originating at the ascending aorta, traversing the aortic arch, and concluding at the descending aorta. As the fluid enters the aortic arch, it diverges into the right and left subclavian and common arteries. To mimic in vivo circulation, the flow constantly pulses throughout the animation.
