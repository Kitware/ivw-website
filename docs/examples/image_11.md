Convergent Science uses ParaView and Catalyst in their CONVERGE software to improve capture of high-speed physical phenomena inside internal combustion engines such as knocking. Catalyst allows saving isosurfaces at a rate much higher than is possible than saving full datasets and can reduce file output from ~100 gigabytes to ~100 megabytes in a typical simulation.
