Acoustic modal analysis of a car cabin by [Undabit Acoustic Simulations](https://undabit.com/). Identifying vibration modes that may impact acoustic properties is crucial, as acoustic resonances can amplify noise generated by the engine, a phenomenon often referred to as "booming." Understanding the frequencies at which resonance occurs and the spatial distribution of the resonant field is essential. Visualization with ParaView's advanced ray-tracing capabilities.
