Pan3D is a fast, highly interactive visualization tool for Xarray datasets — a standard format for large, multidimensional arrays in climatology and other geospatial fields. Built on Trame and VTK, it leverages seamless interoperability between VTK and Xarray for efficient data exchange. A defining feature of Pan3D is its collection of Explorers (pictured above): lightweight, task-focused analysis apps that cut through the clutter of traditional, full-featured visualization tools such as ParaView. These explorers enable teams to craft bespoke, purpose-driven solutions, fostering collaboration and clear role separation.

**Frameworks used:** VTK, Trame
