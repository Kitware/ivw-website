# Virtual Wave Tank Simulation

![Virtual Wave Tank Simulation](../images/supercomputing-2025-2.jpg)

This figure shows an OpenFoam simulation of a boat inside a virtual wave tank. The application was created for Sandia National Laboratories' Water Power Technologies Program. Applications like this can greatly reduce expenses – compared to either a physical wave tank or the manual creation of simulation inputs.

**Frameworks used:** SMTK, CMB, VTK, ParaView
