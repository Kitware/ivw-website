High-resolution 3D characterization is crucial for workflows in materials science and nanoscience. This requires advanced image processing, data analysis, visualization, and reproducibility. Integrating these features into a single environment streamlines the entire research pipeline, from raw data to publication-quality 3D renderings. Furthermore, incorporating capabilities like Python scripting and custom extensions expands its applicability to diverse workflows. Tomviz is an example that offers visualization, processing, and analysis for tomographic data. The image above from Tomviz demonstrates drawing a cropping region around 3D reconstructed PtCu nanoparticles, known for their effectiveness as fuel cell electrocatalysts.
