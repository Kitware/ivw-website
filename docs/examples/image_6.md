Parsli is a VTK-based viewer for fault system kinematics that enables rapid exploration and export of time-based animations. By leveraging advanced 3D graphics, interactive visualization, and high performance, we've transformed a workflow that once took days into one that now takes minutes—or even seconds—for initial validation and analysis. Its ease of use and installation has also encouraged the community to revisit past runs, uncovering phenomena that previously slipped through the cracks of the previous toolchain.

**Frameworks used:** Trame, VTK
