# OpenFOAM Wave Motion Analysis

![OpenFOAM Wave Motion Analysis](/image_1.jpg)

This figure shows an OpenFOAM workflow Kitware created for Sandia National Laboratories to evaluate the reactions of objects to wave motion. What's shown is a ship being inserted into the tank. The box around the aft portion of the vessel is a preview of the OpenFOAM overset mesh (snapped to the ship exterior) that has been crinkle-clipped to reveal the forward part of the ship. This allows inspection of meshes before running a simulation.

**Frameworks used:** SMTK, VTK, ParaView
