Computational fluid dynamics workflows, like OpenFOAM-based wind tunnel simulation shown above, require users to perform various tasks: problem setup, mesh generation, simulation processing, and post-processing. Decomposing these complex workflows into manageable, guided tasks is crucial for effective user management.

**Frameworks used:** VTK, CMB, ParaView, SMTK
