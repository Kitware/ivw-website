# Digital Twin Visualization

![Digital Twin Visualization](/image_19.jpg)

Live visualization of a drive train digital twin. Data from 30 temperature sensors on an electric motor are interpolated onto a digital twin model for live display in ParaView. This allows engineers from TotalEnergies to have direct access to a visualization showcasing the measured elements as it is running, and perform analysis and visualization within ParaView, either using the whole set of existing filters or even implementing their own.
