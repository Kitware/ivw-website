# ArrowFlow - Simulation Template System

![ArrowFlow - Simulation Template System](../images/supercomputing-2025-15.jpg)

ArrowFlow focuses on broadening simulation usage by allowing domain scientists to easily create templates and expose them to remote engineers. Its curated web interface for input simulation parameters and easy to use post-processing tools enables quick exploration for validation of settings to use with factory mixer, drier or any machinery setup into the system.

ArrowFlow relies on M-Star CFD™ for its solver and ParaView for its post-processing. Trame is exposing templates, solver and post-processing visualization in an easy to use solution.

**Frameworks used:** Trame, ParaView
